# Multiplayer-Web-App
## This is a proof of concept
### Features:
* Server Side Map Generation 
* Server Side Bullets and Collisions
* Client Side Player Collisions with world generated by server
#### Glitches:
* Other Player Muzzle Flash doesn't always spawn
* Sometimes there's an extra bullet that doesn't move because its not in the array
* Random Server crashes unkown due to lack of logging at the moment
##### Redundancy:
* Some code is in both client and server as it's halfway done being migrated from client side to server side scripting.
